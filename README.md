#About
CounterDraft is a company that offer a online service for fantasy sport gaming. Our mission is to provide the fun of
fantasy gaming but on a smaller and more intimate level. With all respect to the large businesses in the industry, a game 30k people and a entry fee of 5.00USD is ok but it losses the feel of a true gaming experince. CounterDraft wants to bridge the gap between fantasy playing and a trandtional poker game and allow players to play online fantasy gaming with a min of 7 - 30 plays.
